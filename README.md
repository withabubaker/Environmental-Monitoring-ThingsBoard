# Environmental-Monitoring-ThingsBoard
An inexpensive and efficient way to stream temperature and humidity data in real-time. This project uses open-source Pareto Anywhere middleware to fetch data from Minew S1 BLE sensor, then pushes the readings to a ThingsBoard dashboard via the MQTT protocol. Ideal for smart buildings, labs, or manufacturing environments.
